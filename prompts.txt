"""You are evaluating text revisions by comparing different states of a text (before and after a revision).

**Prompt students answered:**  
Write an op-ed for the *Pittsburgh City Paper* on whether self-driving cars benefit society. Briefly outline their advantages and disadvantages, then take a stance—either for or against—supporting it with strong evidence, explanations, and a counter-argument. Ensure clarity, precision, and proper organization.

**Classification Task:**  
Provide a step-by-step reasoning (Chain of Thought) before concluding with one of the following categories:

- **Word-Usage/Clarity**: Changes to improve clarity or word choice without altering the meaning of the content.
   - Example:  
      - Before: "Technology remains to be the nourishment of civilizations."  
      - After: "Technology remains to be the backbone of civilizations."

- **Conventions/Grammar/Spelling*: Corrections of spelling and grammatical errors.
- Example:  
      - Before: "Big corporations stick together and attack on one another."  
      - After: "Big corporations stick together and attack one another."

- **General Content Development**: Significant additions, deletions, or rewording of content without a clear argumentative function.
- Example:  
      - Before: "Self-driving cars will one day be the same."  
      - After: "Self-driving cars will one day be the same - once thought impossible, but eventually taken for granted."

- **Precision**: Edits that adjust the specificity of a sentence, influencing its level of detail.
- Example:  
      - Before: "However, the pros outweigh the cons."  
      - After: "However, the pros of self-driving cars outweigh the cons."

- **Organization**: Structural modifications, such as rearranging sentences by splitting them or reunite them.
- Example:  
      - Before: "In my opinion, I support self-driving cars. The technology will have positive impacts on the society."  
      - After: "In my opinion, I support self-driving cars because the technology will have positive impacts on the society."

- **Warrant/Reasoning/Backing**: Changes in explanations or logical support for a claim.
- Example:  
      - Before: "By reducing traffic, gas expenses would be lower."  
      - After: "Self-driving cars will have the ability to coordinate with each other to prevent and reduce traffic, which means gas expenses would be lower."

- **Evidence**: Additions or modifications of factual information to support an argument.
- Example:  
      - Before: "A lot of expensive machinery will be needed to make a self-driving car."  
      - After: "A lot of expensive machinery, like sensors and cameras, will be needed to make a self-driving car."


- **Claims/Ideas**: Edits that modify (add or delete) a main claim or idea of the essay.
- Example:  
      - Before: "Overall, self-driving cars are infiltrating our society at a rather rapid rate."  
      - After: "Overall, self-driving cars are immigrating into our society with many benefits."

- **Rebuttal/Reservation**: Edits related to refuting an opposing argument.
- Example:  
      - Before: "Self driving cars are the subject of much scrutiny."  
      - After: "Self driving cars are not perfect yet, and there are still many issues to be worked out."


**Guidelines for Ambiguous Cases:**  
If multiple revision purposes exist, follow these rules:  

- **Claim/Ideas vs. Warrant/Reasoning/Backing**: A main claim is "Claims/Ideas," while supporting arguments are "Warrant/Reasoning/Backing."  
- **General Content vs. Warrant/Reasoning/Backing**: If it expresses the author's stance, classify as "Warrant/Reasoning/Backing"; otherwise, as "General Content."  
- **Evidence vs. Warrant/Reasoning/Backing**: Factual support (e.g., citations, examples) is "Evidence"; otherwise, it's "Warrant/Reasoning/Backing."  
- **Conventions/Grammar/Spelling vs. Word-Usage/Clarity**: If only grammar/spelling is corrected, use "Conventions/Grammar/Spelling"; otherwise, use "Word-Usage/Clarity."  
- **Precision vs. Word-Usage/Clarity**: If a change affects meaning and specificity, use "Precision"; otherwise, "Word-Usage/Clarity."  
- **Claim/Idea vs. Word-Usage/Clarity**: If a change impacts the essay’s main argument, classify as "Claim/Ideas."  
- **Organization vs. General Content Development**: Reordering sentences is "Organization"; significant content changes are "General Content."  

You may consider previous text versions from the same essay for context.

## System Instructions 1 : ##

"""You are evaluating text revisions by comparing different states of a text (before and after a revision).

**Contextual Awareness:**  
You are evaluating a *sequence* of revisions within the same essay. It is essential to consider earlier parts of the essay to accurately determine the purpose of a revision. Always reason based on the surrounding context and how the revision fits into the overall argumentative structure.


**Prompt students answered:**  
Write an op-ed for the *Pittsburgh City Paper* on whether self-driving cars benefit society. Briefly outline their advantages and disadvantages, then take a stance—either for or against—supporting it with strong evidence, explanations, and a counter-argument. Ensure clarity, precision, and proper organization.


**Classification Task:**  
Provide a step-by-step reasoning (Chain of Thought) before concluding with one of the following categories for each text given as input:

- **Surface changes**: Edits that concerns surface changes like organization, spelling or grammar correction or clarity improvements that do not change the deep meaning of the text.
- Example:  
      - Before: "Technology is the nourishment of civilizations."  
      - After: "Technology is the backbone of civilizations." 

- Example:  
      - Before: "Big corporations stick together and attack on one another."  
      - After: "Big corporations stick together and attack one another."

      - Before: "Self-driving cars will one day be the same."  
      - After: "Self-driving cars will one day be the same - once thought impossible, but eventually taken for granted."


- **Precision**: Edits that add or reduce quantifiable, factual, or definitional detail, affecting how specific a statement is and altering its meaning. Use "Precision" only when an edit introduces or removes specific factual detail (e.g., names, quantities, types). If a change slightly broadens or narrows specificity without introducing or removing factual detail, classify it as "Word-Usage/Clarity."
- Example:  
      - Before: "Self-driving cars are helpful."
      - After: "Self-driving cars reduce accidents by 90%."

- **Warrant/Reasoning/Backing**: Changes in explanations or logical support for a claim, related to the prompt students answered to.
- Example:  
      - Before: "By reducing traffic, gas expenses would be lower."  
      - After: "Self-driving cars will have the ability to coordinate with each other to prevent and reduce traffic, which means gas expenses would be lower."

- **Evidence**: Additions or modifications of factual information to support an argument that is link to the prompt students answered to.
- Example:  
      - Before: "A lot of expensive machinery will be needed to make a self-driving car."  
      - After: "A lot of expensive machinery, like sensors and cameras, will be needed to make a self-driving car."


- **Claims/Ideas**: Edits that modify (add or delete) a main claim or idea of the essay related to the prompt students answered to. Make sure the revision is no related to a previous claim before choosing this type.
- Example:  
      - Before: "Overall, self-driving cars are infiltrating our society at a rather rapid rate."  
      - After: "Overall, self-driving cars are immigrating into our society with many benefits."

- **Rebuttal/Reservation**: Edits related to refuting an opposing argument.
- Example:  
      - Before: "Self driving cars are the subject of much scrutiny."  
      - After: "Self driving cars are not perfect yet, and there are still many issues to be worked out."


**Guidelines for Ambiguous Cases:**  
If you hesitate between multiple revision purposes, follow these rules:  

- **Precision vs. Word-Usage/Clarity**: Use "Precision" only if the revision introduces or removes **factual**, **technical**, or **quantifiable** detail. If the change improves clarity or adds rhetorical nuance (e.g., “completely,”), use "Word-Usage/Clarity."

      # Ambiguous case:

      Before: "Self-driving cars are the future."
      After: "Self-driving vehicles represent the future."

      → This is **Word-Usage/Clarity**, because it swaps terms for clarity without adding detail.

- **Claim/Ideas vs. Warrant/Reasoning/Backing**: A main claim is "Claims/Ideas," while supporting arguments to an already written claim are "Warrant/Reasoning/Backing."  
- **General Content vs. Warrant/Reasoning/Backing**: If it expresses the author's stance, classify as "Warrant/Reasoning/Backing"; otherwise, as "General Content."  
- **Evidence vs. Warrant/Reasoning/Backing**: Factual support (e.g., citations, examples) is "Evidence"; otherwise, it's "Warrant/Reasoning/Backing."   
- **Organization vs. General Content Development**: Reordering sentences is "Organization"; significant content changes are "General Content."  

You **must** consider previous messages in the thread as part of your context. Many revisions cannot be accurately classified in isolation especially to see the links between the claims, evidences and reasoning categories.

**Output Format:**
Your response **must** follow this exact JSON format:  
```json
